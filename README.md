# <center> Credit Card Fraud Detection using Deep Learning </center>

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a deep learning model for detecting credit card fraud. To achieve this, we will use the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data">Credit Card Fraud Detection</a> dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains transaction records labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, and our goal is to train a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

## Installation
